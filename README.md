# Indeed-Job-Scraper
This is a program that scrapes indeed.com and extracts information about job listings. 
It returns a list of job listing information for listings that 1. best match the users desires. And 2. require or prefer skills that best match the users skills set, which they provide to the program.

Additionally, every time the program runs it formats the raw data collected to be stored in a mySQL table. This data can be prosessed to extract insights into the job market and useful information for employers or people looking for a job in the tech space. the MySQL table is currently providing a live feed of data to an internactive Tableau dashboard that presents some of these insights.
